cd my-app
npm start

React - 18 version

React.createElement("h1",{className:"head"},"Welcome to React") 

<h1>Welcome to React</h1>

JSX --> Special type of Syntax introduced by react to make code easy 

it is alsmost similar to html but it isnot html nor js 

Does jsx understood by Browser ?   ----> (no)


There is a compiler known as Babel 


Babel --> jsx to js 





Component -->1. Class Components (old way of writing) 2. Functional Component (latest way of writing react code)


Component is nothing but a normal javascript function which returns jsx 


const Head=()=>{

return (
    <div></div>

)


}

//now we are going to create a Component
